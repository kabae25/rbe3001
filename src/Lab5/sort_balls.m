% In this file, write your "main" script for picking up the balls
% This should only be 10-15 lines long, the vast majority of the work
% should be in your Robot and ImageProcessor classes

% Ultimately it's up to you to decide how to organize this, but the
% "detect_balls" and "pick_up_ball" functions should do a lot of the work
% for you.
